# KMM Image Generation App â€” Stable Diffusion on Mobile

This project focuses on **mathematical modeling of image generation systems**, evaluating their performance, and integrating them into a **mobile application**.  
The main goal is to explore AI-based image generation methods and develop an efficient system for practical use.

## Key Features

- **Text-to-Image**: Generate images from text prompts
- **Image-to-Image**: Transform existing images with AI
- **Multiple styles**: Support for diverse artistic styles
- **Parameter control**: Adjust generation parameters (resolution, steps, guidance, etc.)
- **Image editing**: Modify uploaded images directly in the app
- **Cross-platform support**: Built with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)
- **Optimized performance**: Quantization and model optimization for mobile devices

## Research Objectives

- Explore theoretical foundations of image generation, focusing on **Stable Diffusion**
- Study technologies required for cross-platform mobile apps with **KMM**
- Investigate technical aspects of integrating diffusion models into mobile apps
- Develop a user-friendly interface with generation parameter controls
- Test the app across different devices and evaluate performance
- Compare results with alternative generation methods

## Technology Stack

- **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)** â€” cross-platform mobile development
- **Stable Diffusion** â€” AI image generation model
- **PyTorch / ONNX Runtime** â€” model optimization and deployment
- **Jetpack Compose / SwiftUI** â€” UI for Android and iOS
- **Firebase** â€” authentication, storage, and cloud integration
